# vimrc
My vim configuration.
# Install
I used [Vundle](http://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.Vim) to install the plugins.
So first you need to install it.
After you have finished that you can go on.
```
git clone https://github.com/firdewald/vimrc ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc/vimrc ~/.vimrc
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```
